# 🎬 MovAI 
This project was built as a Final Project for DS/AI Class – Agentic Chatbot with Langchain-style Architecture

# 📌 Short Description
MovAI is an intelligent movie chatbot powered by a Large Language Model (Google Gemini) that helps users discover and explore films through natural conversation. It supports search and recommendations by title, genre, year, director, actor, and even user mood. Built with Langchain and Streamlit, and enhanced with RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for contextual search using vector similarity from IMDB data.
